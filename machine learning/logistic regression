Using the full data to perform logistic regression with “Direction” as the response
and the five lag variables, plus volume, as predictors. Using the summary
function to print the results.

attach(Weekly)
Weekly.fit<-glm(Direction~Lag1+Lag2+Lag3+Lag4+Lag5+Volume, data=Weekly,family=binomial)
summary(Weekly.fit)

the lag2 variable appears to be  statistically significant 

#the “confusion matrix” and overall fraction of correct predictions. 


logWeekly_prob= predict(Weekly.fit, type='response')
logWeekly_pred =rep("FALSE", length(logWeekly_prob))
logWeekly_pred[logWeekly_prob > 0.5] = "TRUE"
table(logWeekly_pred, Direction)
  output:            Direction
logWeekly_pred Down  Up
         FALSE   54  48
         TRUE   430 557
